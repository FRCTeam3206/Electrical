/*
  SD card test

 This example shows how use the utility libraries on which the'
 SD library is based in order to get info about your SD card.
 Very useful for testing a card when you're not sure whether its working or not.

 The circuit:
  * SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** MOSI - pin 11 on Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/Diecimila
 ** MISO - pin 12 on Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/Diecimila
 ** CLK - pin 13 on Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/Diecimila
 ** CS - depends on your SD card shield or module.

 by Raj Gandhi -- This works with a Uno compatible and CAN shield (with SD card)
 It was challenging to FAT32 format the 2Gb card corrctly and make it all work.

// include the SD library:
#include <SPI.h>
#include <SD.h>

// set up variables using the SD utility library functions:
Sd2Card card;
SdVolume volume;
SdFile root;

// change this to match your SD shield or module;
// Arduino Ethernet shield: pin 4
// Adafruit SD shields and modules: pin 10
// Sparkfun SD shield: pin 8
// RG: pin 8 is correct.
const int chipSelect = 8;
/***
RG: Oy.  The Zumo uses DIO8 for motor right.  That means there's a conflict using pin 8 for the SD card.
All is not lost.  There are two methods for controlling the Zumobot motors.  I think we're using the PWM inputs
on pins 9 and 10 rather than pins 7 and 8.

To do: verify that we're using pins 9 and 10.  Then cut pin 8 on the header that goes to the Zumo.
The solution would probably be to find and cut the line to 8 after ensuring.

Cutting 8 between Zumo and Arduino doesn't look like a great idea.  Maybe more effort with ZumoMotors.cpp would elucidate.

Alternatively, cut and jump between the Arduino and CAN shield.  Table this for now.
